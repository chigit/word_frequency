This word count program is written in Python.
It takes as an input, the path to the directory (wc_input, containing several text files) and produces a new text file (which you can name wc_results.txt in some wc_output directory) containing an alphabetically sorted list of words and their frequency of occurence across all the text files in the input directory.

To run, type in the following at the terminal and follow the prompts:
word_frequency()

The wc_input foler here was a test directory for the source code.
