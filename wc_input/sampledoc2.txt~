LYNCHBURG, Va. — Sen. Ted Cruz kicked off a new phase in the 2016 presidential race Monday when he declared himself a candidate for the GOP nomination, setting the stage for a frenetic battle among Republicans eager to take back the White House.
Cruz made it official just after midnight, tweeting: "I'm running for President and I hope to earn your support!"
His decision to run had been reported throughout the previous day by news organizations. In a campaign video included with his tweet, the newly minted GOP presidential candidate said, "It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again, and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight."
Cruz, a freshman senator from Texas, is one of several Tea Party favorites hoping to be the party standard-bearer who can erase the sting of defeats by Mitt Romney and John McCain.
He'll have his work cut out for him in a crowded field that is shaping up to include former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, as well as Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky — who, like Cruz, were swept into office by Tea Party insurgents.
"From here it's only up. We have a lot of great candidates that are about to come in and join the field," said Taylor Budowich, executive director of the Tea Party Express, the largest Tea Party political action committee. "Tea Partiers and conservatives of every stripe are pretty excited about what's to come in the presidential race."
Cruz, a fiery orator and unyielding conservative, is set to deliver formal remarks about 10:25 a.m. ET from Liberty University. While the Texan considers himself a full-spectrum conservative who appeals to all in the GOP, he is sending a clear signal with his choice of venue that he intends to compete for the votes of religious conservatives.
About a year ago, Cruz used a speech at the world's largest Christian university to say religious liberty is "under assault" by the Obama administration. He cited as a prime example the provision in the Affordable Care Act requiring insurance coverage for contraceptives. The Supreme Court last June said some for-profit companies don't have to pay if they object on religious grounds.
Analysts say Cruz's policy positions will serve him well in the Iowa caucuses, scheduled for Feb. 1, where evangelical and social conservatives helped propel former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum to victory in 2008 and 2012, respectively.
Cruz is "probably the ideal candidate for a lot of conservative types who are activists and the Republicans that caucus," said Craig Robinson, founder of the Iowa Republican website and a former political director of the Iowa GOP. "He's the natural fit -- a strong social conservative who has the fighter mentality. He's going to be right on all their issues."
Early public opinion polls on the 2016 GOP race have either Walker or Bush in the lead, with Cruz rating in the single digits. By announcing first, the Texas senator will dominate headlines and benefit from news coverage until the rest of the field takes shape.
Budowich, the Tea Party leader, said Cruz and other GOP candidates need to show they can appeal to a broad range of voters if they want to win in 2016. He believes the senator's call for "opportunity conservatism" -- in which the GOP offers policies that help everyone and not just the wealthy will help Cruz.
"You have to articulate your vision for America," he said. "We can't just talk to ourselves. We can't win a national election if we don't expand the voter base."
